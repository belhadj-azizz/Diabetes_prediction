# Diabetes_prediction
This project aims to predict diabetes prevalence based on a set of a patient's features. 
In this project, I'll be trying out different machine learning techniques from basic decision trees to shallow NNs (LR, 1 hidden layer) and finally multiple layers NNs and compare their performance on this dataset.
